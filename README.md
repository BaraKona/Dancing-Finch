# Dancing-Finch

This Java project was assigned to me during my first year of university.
It involved coding a finch robot supplied to us with its basic functions.
My task in particular was the Dancing Finch Task. This involved coding an algorithm that would convert a Hexadecimal number into its binary, octal and decimal equivalents.
